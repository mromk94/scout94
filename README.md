## 🔍 AUDITOR - Independent Quality Control

**NEW:** Scout94 now includes an independent LLM auditor!

### **What the Auditor Does:**

1. **Reviews Scout94 test results** with fresh eyes
2. **Scores testing quality** 1-10 on:
   - Completeness (did we test the right things?)
   - Methodology (are tests well-designed?)
   - Coverage (are critical paths covered?)
3. **Identifies gaps** in testing
4. **Provides recommendations** for improvement
5. **Auto-retries** Scout94 if score < 5

### **Supported LLMs:**

- ✅ **OpenAI GPT-4** (recommended)
- ✅ **Google Gemini**
- ✅ **Mock mode** (for testing without API key)

### **Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Add your API key (choose ONE)
# For OpenAI:
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" > .env

# For Gemini:
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
```

### **Usage:**

```bash
# Run Scout94 WITH auditor
php run_with_audit.php "/Users/mac/CascadeProjects/Viz Venture Group"
```

### **How It Works:**

```
1. Run Scout94 tests → Generate results
2. Send results to LLM auditor → Get independent review
3. Check audit score:
   - Score ≥ 5 → ✅ Approved! Generate report
   - Score < 5 → 🔄 Re-run Scout94 with recommendations
4. Maximum 3 retries (4 total attempts)
5. Smart exit if stuck (same score 2x)
6. Always delivers report (success or failure)
```

### **Infinite Loop Prevention:**

✅ **Hard Limit:** Max 4 attempts (initial + 3 retries)  
✅ **Stuck Detection:** Exits early if score unchanged  
✅ **Score Tracking:** Monitors improvement trends  
✅ **Always Delivers:** Report generated even on failure  

See `RETRY_LOGIC.md` for detailed explanation.

#### **The Meta-Test Process**

```
1. User Command: "Run comprehensive scan on Scout94's Settings Panel"
   ↓
2. Scout94 analyzes 4,601 lines across 17 files
   → Detects patterns, duplicates, issues
   → Applies same standards it uses on user projects
   ↓
3. Generates analysis report with 64 findings
   → 1 HIGH, 23 MEDIUM, 40 LOW, 10 INFO
   → Initial health score: 0.0/10 (algorithm too harsh)
   ↓
4. Human validation against root causes
   → Filter false positives (intentional patterns)
   → Validate true issues (async error handling)
   → Actual health score: 7.5/10 (production-ready)
   ↓
5. Systematic fixes applied (5 hours)
   → Priority 1: Critical fixes (15 min)
   → Priority 2: Accessibility (1.5 hrs)
   → Priority 3: Type safety (2.5 hrs)
   → Priority 4: Code quality (45 min)
   ↓
6. Final validation
   → Health score: 9.1/10 (+21% improvement)
   → 64 issues resolved
   → Production-ready quality achieved
```

##  When Scout94 Runs

When you trigger **Scout94** or **Scout94 2**, Cascade will:

1. **Automatically run these scripts** from this directory
2. **Report results** in real-time
3. **Send to LLM auditor** for independent review
4. **Auto-retry if score < 5** with auditor recommendations
5. **Fix issues** found immediately
6. **Generate audited report** (only scores ≥5 delivered)

---

##  Adding New Tests

To add a new test to Scout94:

1. Create script in `scout94/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `test_[feature].php`
3. Include clear output (✅/❌ indicators)
4. Return exit code 0 for success, 1 for failure
5. Update this README
6. Update Scout94 memory to include the new test

---

##  Notes

- **DO NOT** commit these scripts to production packages
- Scripts are for **local development and pre-deployment validation only**
- All scripts should be **non-destructive** (create test databases, not modify production)
- Scripts should **clean up after themselves** (drop test databases)

## 📋 CHANGELOG

### **October 16, 2025 - Mock Detection System**

**🔍 New Feature:**
- Added comprehensive mock detection system for data authenticity verification
- Analyzes all scan results for mock/placeholder patterns
- Calculates confidence score (0-100%) with verdicts (REAL, PARTIAL, MOSTLY_MOCK, COMPLETE_MOCK)
- Detects missing scans, empty results, suspicious perfection, incomplete data
- Reports authenticity in chat messages and markdown reports
- See `MOCK_DETECTION_PROTOCOL.md` for complete specification

**📚 Files Created:**
- `websocket-server/mock-detector.js` - Core detection engine
- `MOCK_DETECTION_PROTOCOL.md` - Complete protocol documentation

**🔄 Integration:**
- `comprehensive-scan-command.js` - Runs detection after scans
- `markdown-report-generator.js` - Adds authenticity section to reports

---

### **October 16, 2025 - Phase 2 Bug Fixes**

**🔧 Critical Fixes:**
- Fixed undefined method `Scout94Clinic::generateTreatment()` - Clinic flow now properly uses internal methods
- Fixed undefined array key `health_status` - Using correct return value keys from clinic
- **Fixed IDE live updates for Auditor** - Added output buffer flush to `writeAgentSummary()`
- Fixed agent attribution - Clinic activities now appear under Doctor 🩺 and Nurse 💉 (not scout94)
- Added `screenshotter` alias to agent profiles for name flexibility

**🎯 Root Causes Addressed:**
1. **Output Buffering:** PHP was buffering `REPORT_WRITE` signals - added explicit `flush()` calls
2. **Missing AGENT_MESSAGE Wrappers:** Clinic was using raw echo - wrapped all output with proper JSON signals
3. **Misunderstood Clinic Flow:** `admitPatient()` is all-in-one method - removed non-existent method calls

**📝 Files Modified:**
- `run_comprehensive_with_agents.php` - Fixed clinic integration
- `php-helpers/report-helper.php` - Added buffer flushing
- `scout94_clinic.php` - Wrapped all output with AGENT_MESSAGE
- `ui/src/components/ChatBubble_old.jsx` - Added screenshotter alias

**📚 Documentation:**
- Created `FIXES_APPLIED_OCT16.md` - Phase 1 fixes (collaborative reporting integration)
- Created `FIXES_APPLIED_OCT16_PHASE2.md` - Phase 2 fixes (bug fixes and root cause analysis)

---

## 🎨 IDE Improvements (October 16, 2025)

Scout94's IDE interface has been enhanced with professional-grade features:

### **Responsive Layout**
- ✅ **Resizable panels**: User can drag to adjust IDE/Chat split width
- ✅ **Resizable file explorer**: Adjustable sidebar width
- ✅ **Line wrapping**: Code adapts to container width changes
- ✅ **Window responsive**: Adapts to any screen size smoothly

### **Professional Code Display**
- ✅ **Prominent line numbering**: Bold, clear gutter with distinct background
- ✅ **Protected line number lane**: Numbers stay in fixed column
- ✅ **Syntax highlighting**: Full language support with proper wrapping
- ✅ **Minified file detection**: Warns when viewing build artifacts

### **Breadcrumb Navigation**
- ✅ **Interactive path display**: Folder › Subfolder › File
- ✅ **File type badges**: Language indicator (php, jsx, css, etc.)
- ✅ **Hover effects**: Visual feedback on path segments
- ✅ **Current file highlight**: Active file shown with blue pill badge

### **Technical Implementation**
- Uses SyntaxHighlighter's native capabilities (no library fighting)
- Grid-based responsive panel layout
- Proper line wrapping with `wrapLines={true}` and `wrapLongLines={true}`
- Sticky line number gutter with visual separator

---

## 🔍 Mock Detection Protocol

Scout94 enforces **data authenticity verification** across all test runs and reports.

### **Why Mock Detection Matters**
- Real vs. placeholder data must be clearly distinguished
- Mock data can give false confidence ("zero errors" when logs don't exist)
- Users make production decisions based on Scout94 reports
- Honesty about data completeness builds trust

### **How It Works**
1. **Analyze** all scan results for authenticity patterns
2. **Calculate** confidence score (0-100%) based on indicators
3. **Flag** mock/placeholder patterns prominently
4. **Report** data quality in chat, reports, and collaborative summaries

### **Detection Patterns**
- Missing scans (logs, security, performance)
- Empty results (zero files, zero errors)
- Suspiciously perfect data (unrealistic cleanliness)
- Incomplete data structures
- Failed/skipped analysis steps

### **Confidence Verdicts**
- ✅ **REAL (80-100%)**: Authentic scan data
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL (50-79%)**: Mix of real and mock
- ❌ **MOSTLY_MOCK (20-49%)**: Primarily placeholder
- 🚫 **COMPLETE_MOCK (0-19%)**: No real scans executed

### **Documentation**
See `MOCK_DETECTION_PROTOCOL.md` for complete specification, integration points, and examples.

---

## 🎯 Accountability Protocol

Scout94 now enforces a strict **Root Cause First** methodology across all AI agents.

### **Documentation**
See `websocket-server/ACCOUNTABILITY_PROTOCOL.md` for complete details.

### **Key Principles**
1. **STOP and investigate** before proposing solutions
2. **Root cause analysis** required for every fix
3. **Investigation evidence** must be provided
4. **Holistic context** must be considered
5. **No band-aids** - fix causes, not symptoms

### **Enforcement**
- All agents validate solutions through `DecisionValidator`
- Solutions rejected if accountability checks fail
- Fighting libraries = automatic rejection
- Lazy shortcuts flagged and prevented

### **Example: Line Numbering Fix**
❌ **Wrong**: Try different CSS, force grid layout, fight the library  
✅ **Right**: Investigate → Library has native props → Use `lineNumberContainerStyle` and `wrapLines`

This ensures Scout94 maintains the same high standards across its entire ecosystem.
