# üöÄ SCOUT94 CLI MANAGER - COMPLETE GUIDE

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

Comprehensive command-line interface for Scout94 that can be called from **ANY directory**, supports background execution, and provides full process management.

---

## ‚ö° **QUICK START**

### **Installation:**
```bash
# Already installed! The script is executable and linked to /usr/local/bin
```

### **Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Start from current directory
scout94 start

# Start with specific path
scout94 start /path/to/project

# Start in clinic mode
scout94 start --mode=clinic

# Check status
scout94 status

# View logs
scout94 logs

# Stop
scout94 stop
```

---

## üìö **COMMANDS**

### **1. START**
```bash
scout94 start [path] [--mode=audit|clinic|basic]
```

**What it does:**
- Starts Scout94 in background (daemon mode)
- Can be called from ANY directory
- Auto-detects target path or uses current directory
- Returns immediately (non-blocking)
- Logs output to `.scout94.log`

**Examples:**
```bash
# Start in current directory
cd /path/to/project
scout94 start

# Start with explicit path
scout94 start /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/MyProject

# Start in clinic mode (self-healing)
scout94 start --mode=clinic

# Start from different folder with path
cd ~
scout94 start /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/MyProject --mode=audit
```

**Modes:**
- `audit` (default) - LLM auditor + auto-retry
- `clinic` - Self-healing with doctor/clinic
- `basic` - Tests only, no auditor

---

### **2. STOP**
```bash
scout94 stop
```

**What it does:**
- Gracefully stops running Scout94 process
- Cleans up PID and state files
- Safe to run even if Scout94 not running

**Example:**
```bash
scout94 stop
# Output: ‚úÖ Scout94 stopped
```

---

### **3. PAUSE**
```bash
scout94 pause
```

**What it does:**
- Pauses execution (sends STOP signal)
- Process remains in memory
- Can be resumed later

**Example:**
```bash
scout94 pause
# Output: ‚úÖ Scout94 paused
#         üí° Use 'scout94 resume' to continue
```

---

### **4. RESUME**
```bash
scout94 resume
```

**What it does:**
- Resumes paused execution (sends CONT signal)
- Continues from where it left off

**Example:**
```bash
scout94 resume
# Output: ‚úÖ Scout94 resumed
```

---

### **5. RESTART**
```bash
scout94 restart [path] [--mode=audit|clinic|basic]
```

**What it does:**
- Stops current instance (if running)
- Starts new instance with same or new parameters

**Example:**
```bash
# Restart with same path
scout94 restart

# Restart with new path and mode
scout94 restart /new/path --mode=clinic
```

---

### **6. STATUS**
```bash
scout94 status
```

**What it does:**
- Shows current running status
- Displays PID, target, mode, runtime
- Shows last 5 log lines
- Color-coded status indicators

**Example Output:**
```

### **7. LOGS**
```bash
scout94 logs [--tail=N]
```

**What it does:**

scout94 logs --tail=20

# Show last 50 lines
scout94 logs --tail=50
```

## üåç **CALL FROM ANYWHERE**

### **Key Feature: Location Independence**

```bash
# Scenario 1: Call from project directory
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/MyProject
scout94 start
# Uses current directory automatically

# Scenario 2: Call from home directory
cd ~
scout94 start /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/MyProject
# Explicit path works

# Scenario 3: Call from completely different location
cd /tmp
scout94 start ~/CascadeProjects/MyProject
# Relative and absolute paths both work

# Scenario 4: SSH from remote
ssh user@server 'scout94 start /var/www/project --mode=clinic'
# Works over SSH without TTY
```

---

## üîÑ **BACKGROUND EXECUTION**

### **How it Works:**

1. **Daemon Mode:**
   - Scout94 runs in background
   - Terminal can be closed
   - Process continues running

2. **State Tracking:**
   - PID saved to `.scout94.pid`
   - State saved to `.scout94.state`
   - Logs saved to `.scout94.log`

3. **Process Management:**
   - Uses standard Unix signals
   - STOP for pause
   - CONT for resume
   - TERM/KILL for stop

## üîê **SSH USAGE**

### **Remote Execution:**

```bash
# Start Scout94 on remote server
ssh user@server 'scout94 start /var/www/myproject --mode=clinic'

# Check status remotely
ssh user@server 'scout94 status'

# View logs remotely
ssh user@server 'scout94 logs --tail=50'

# Stop remotely
ssh user@server 'scout94 stop'
```

### **Automated Deployment Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy.sh

# Deploy code
rsync -avz ./myproject/ user@server:/var/www/myproject/

# Run Scout94 tests
ssh user@server << 'EOF'
  cd /var/www/myproject
  scout94 start --mode=audit
  
  # Wait for completion
  while scout94 status | grep -q "running"; do
    sleep 5
  done
  
  # Check if passed
  if scout94 report | grep -q "AUDITED_REPORT"; then
    echo "‚úÖ Tests passed! Deploying..."
    # Deployment logic here
  else
    echo "‚ùå Tests failed! Aborting deployment"
    scout94 logs --tail=100
    exit 1
  fi
EOF
```

## üéØ **TYPICAL WORKFLOWS**

### **Workflow 1: Development Testing**

```bash
# Make code changes...

# Run tests
cd ~/myproject
scout94 start --mode=audit

# Check progress
scout94 status

# View live logs
watch -n 2 scout94 logs --tail=20

# When done, check report
scout94 report
```

### **Workflow 2: CI/CD Pipeline**

```bash
# In CI script
scout94 start $PROJECT_PATH --mode=clinic

# Poll for completion
until scout94 status | grep -q "stopped"; do
  sleep 10
done

# Get exit status from report
if scout94 report | grep -q "AUDITED_REPORT\|HEALED_REPORT"; then
  echo "PASSED"
  exit 0
else
  echo "FAILED"
  scout94 logs
  exit 1
fi
```

### **Workflow 3: Scheduled Testing**

```bash
# Crontab entry
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/scout94 start /var/www/project --mode=audit

# Check results in morning
scout94 report
scout94 logs --tail=100
```

# Option 3: Create symlink (may need sudo)
sudo ln -sf /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94/scout94 /usr/local/bin/scout94
```

### **"Already running" but status shows stopped**

```bash
# Clean up stale files
rm /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94/.scout94.pid
rm /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94/.scout94.state

# Try again
scout94 start
```

### **Logs not showing**

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94/.scout94.log

# View with tail
tail -f /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94/.scout94.log
```
