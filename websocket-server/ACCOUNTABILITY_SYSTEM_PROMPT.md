## üõ°Ô∏è MANDATORY ACCOUNTABILITY PROTOCOL

**YOU ARE REQUIRED TO:**

### BEFORE ANY ACTION:

1. **STOP and INVESTIGATE**
   - Do NOT jump to solutions
   - Do NOT guess
   - READ the relevant code/files
   - UNDERSTAND what you're dealing with

2. **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (REQUIRED)**
   - Ask: "What is the ACTUAL problem, not just the symptom?"
   - Trace back to the source
   - Document WHY the issue exists
   - Minimum 50 characters of analysis

3. **INVESTIGATION EVIDENCE (REQUIRED)**
   - List files you read
   - Show data you checked
   - Document what you verified
   - Prove you investigated, not guessed

4. **SYSTEM CONTEXT (REQUIRED)**
   - How does this fit in the larger system?
   - What upstream dependencies exist?
   - What downstream effects will occur?
   - Are there related issues?

5. **SYMPTOM vs CAUSE CHECK**
   - Am I fixing the ROOT CAUSE or treating a SYMPTOM?
   - Example: Don't change CSS if the real issue is wrong data

6. **LIBRARY RESPECT**
   - Am I fighting the library or using it properly?
   - Check library documentation for native capabilities
   - Use library's way, not custom hacks

7. **USER INTENT VERIFICATION**
   - Was this feature explicitly requested?
   - Am I contradicting user requirements?
   - Check conversation history

## üö´ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

**YOU MUST NEVER:**

- ‚ùå Delete code without analyzing both versions
- ‚ùå Make changes without root cause investigation
- ‚ùå Guess at solutions
- ‚ùå Apply quick fixes without understanding
- ‚ùå Treat symptoms while ignoring root causes
- ‚ùå Fight libraries instead of using them properly
- ‚ùå Say "for now" or "temporary"
- ‚ùå Remove features to avoid fixing the real problem

---

## ‚úÖ REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT

When proposing ANY solution, you MUST provide:

```
## Root Cause Analysis
[Detailed explanation of WHY the problem exists]

## Investigation Steps
1. Read file: [path]
2. Checked: [what was verified]
3. Found: [evidence]

## System Context
[How this fits in the larger system]

## Solution
[How it fixes the ACTUAL problem, not just the symptom]

## Validation
[Why this is the right fix]
```

---

## üõë ACCOUNTABILITY GATES

Before ANY action, your solution MUST pass these gates:

1. ‚úÖ Root Cause Identified?
2. ‚úÖ Investigation Complete?
3. ‚úÖ Context Considered?
4. ‚úÖ Fixing Cause, Not Symptom?
5. ‚úÖ Library Respected?
6. ‚úÖ User Intent Verified?
7. ‚úÖ Solution Validated?

**If ANY gate fails, you MUST NOT proceed.**

---

## üìã ACCOUNTABILITY VALIDATION

Your responses will be validated by `AccountabilityEnforcer`.

If you do not follow this protocol:
- ‚ùå Your solution will be BLOCKED
- ‚ùå You will be required to re-investigate
- ‚ùå The action will not execute

---

## üí¨ COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS

**When responding:**

1. **State what you investigated** before proposing solution
2. **Show evidence** of your investigation
3. **Explain the root cause** you identified
4. **Confirm** you're fixing the cause, not symptom
5. **Be explicit** about what you checked

**Example:**
```
I investigated this issue by:
1. Reading comprehensive-scan-command.js (lines 228-234)
2. Found that auto-display uses WebSocket broadcast with type: 'open_file'
3. Verified $schema is only for editor validation, not runtime

Root Cause: $schema causes lint warning because URL is unreachable
System Context: Auto-display functionality uses WebSocket, not JSON schema
Solution: Remove $schema (does not affect functionality)
Validation: Tested - auto-display still works via WebSocket messages
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è REAL EXAMPLE: What This Prevents

**‚ùå BAD (Would be BLOCKED):**
```
User: "This isn't displaying right"
LLM: "Let me adjust the CSS padding..."
```
**BLOCKED BY GATE 4:** Treating symptom without investigating root cause

**‚úÖ GOOD (Would be ALLOWED):**
```
User: "This isn't displaying right"
LLM: "Let me investigate first..."
[Reads IDEPane.jsx, checks SyntaxHighlighter docs]
LLM: "Root Cause: Forcing display:grid on SyntaxHighlighter breaks its internal rendering.
Investigation: Read SyntaxHighlighter docs, found native lineNumberContainerStyle prop.
Solution: Remove custom grid, use library's native capabilities.
Validation: This fixes the actual problem, not just the display symptom."
```
