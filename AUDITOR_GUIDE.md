# 🔍 Scout94 Auditor - Complete Guide

## What Is The Auditor?

The Scout94 Auditor is an **independent quality control system** that uses external LLMs (GPT-4 or Gemini) to review and score Scout94's test results.

**Think of it as:** A second pair of expert eyes reviewing your work.

---

## Why Do We Need It?

### **Problem:**
Even comprehensive tests can miss things:
- ❌ Testing the wrong scenarios
- ❌ Missing edge cases
- ❌ Poor test design
- ❌ Gaps in coverage

### **Solution:**
An independent AI auditor that:
- ✅ Reviews test completeness
- ✅ Evaluates methodology
- ✅ Identifies gaps
- ✅ Scores quality 1-10
- ✅ Auto-retries if score < 5

---

## How It Works

### **Step 1: Run Scout94**
```
php run_all_tests.php → Generate test results
```

### **Step 2: Audit Results**
```
Send results to LLM → Get independent review
```

### **Step 3: Score & Decision**
```
Score ≥ 5 → ✅ Approved, generate report
Score < 5 → 🔄 Retry with recommendations
```

### **Step 4: Retry Logic**
```
Max 2 retries with auditor feedback
If still < 5 → Manual review required
```

## Scoring System

### **Overall Score (1-10):**

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **9-10** | 🟢 Excellent | Approved - Deploy with confidence |
| **7-8** | 🟢 Good | Approved - Minor improvements suggested |
| **5-6** | 🟡 Acceptable | Approved - Follow recommendations |
| **3-4** | 🔴 Poor | Rejected - Auto-retry triggered |
| **1-2** | 🔴 Critical | Rejected - Major issues |

### **Sub-Scores:**

**Completeness (1-10):**
- Did we test the RIGHT things?
- Are all critical features covered?
- Missing any important scenarios?

**Methodology (1-10):**
- Are tests well-designed?
- Do they test real-world use cases?
- Are they reliable and repeatable?

**Coverage (1-10):**
- Do tests cover all critical paths?
- Are edge cases included?
- Security tested adequately?

## Setup Instructions

### **Option 1: OpenAI GPT-4 (Recommended)**

```bash
# 1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

# 2. Create .env file
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Add your key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here" > .env

# 4. Test it
php run_with_audit.php "/path/to/project"
```

**Cost:** ~$0.03-0.10 per audit (GPT-4)

---

### **Option 2: Google Gemini**

```bash
# 1. Get API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

# 2. Create .env file
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Add your key
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here" > .env

# 4. Test it
php run_with_audit.php "/path/to/project"
```

**Cost:** Free tier available

---

### **Option 3: Mock Mode (Testing)**

```bash
# No API key needed - uses simulated auditor
php run_with_audit.php "/path/to/project"
```

**Note:** Mock mode always returns score 8/10 with generic feedback

---

## Usage Examples

### **Basic Usage:**

```bash
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/scout94
php run_with_audit.php "/Users/mac/CascadeProjects/Viz Venture Group"
```

## What Gets Audited?

### **1. Test Completeness**
- Are all user personas tested? (Visitor, User, Admin)
- Are critical paths covered? (Login, Invest, Withdraw)
- Missing scenarios?

### **2. Test Methodology**
- Do tests simulate real user behavior?
- Are tests well-structured?
- Good assertions and validations?

### **3. Coverage**
- Technical tests (routing, database)
- Functional tests (user journeys)
- Security tests
- Edge cases

### **4. Quality Indicators**
- Tests passed/failed ratio
- Number of critical errors
- Number of warnings
- Missing features

---

## Retry Logic

### **When Score < 5:**

```
Attempt 1: Run Scout94
   ↓
Audit: Score 4/10 ❌
   ↓
🔄 RETRY with recommendations
   ↓
Attempt 2: Run Scout94 (improved)
   ↓
Audit: Score 6/10 ✅
   ↓
✅ APPROVED - Generate report
```

### **Example Retry:**

```
❌ AUDIT FAILED (Score: 4/10)
❌ Score below threshold (5)

🔄 Triggering Scout94 retry with recommendations...

📝 AUDITOR RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Add security penetration testing

## Best Practices

### **1. Use Real API Key**
- Mock mode is for testing only
- Real LLM gives much better feedback
- GPT-4 recommended for best results

### **2. Review Recommendations**
- Don't ignore auditor suggestions
- Implement improvements for next deployment
- Build up test coverage over time

### **3. Understand Scores**
- Score 5+ = Safe to deploy
- Score 7+ = Good quality
- Score 9+ = Excellent
- Score < 5 = Needs work

### **4. Trust the Process**
- If auto-retry triggers, there's a reason
- Auditor catches things humans miss
- Independent verification adds confidence

---

## Troubleshooting

### **"No LLM API key found"**
```
⚠️  No LLM API key found. Auditor will run in mock mode.
```
**Fix:** Create `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### **"OpenAI API error (HTTP 401)"**
```
⚠️  OpenAI API error (HTTP 401). Using mock audit.
```
**Fix:** Check your API key is correct and has credits

### **"Auditor response could not be parsed"**
```
Auditor response could not be parsed
```
**Fix:** LLM didn't return valid JSON. Retry or use different LLM

### **Score Always 8/10**
```
OVERALL SCORE: 🟢 8/10 (every time)
```
**Cause:** Running in mock mode (no API key configured)

---

## API Cost Estimates

### **OpenAI GPT-4:**
- Input: ~1,000 tokens per audit
- Output: ~500 tokens per audit
- Cost: ~$0.03-0.10 per audit
- **Monthly (20 audits):** ~$2

### **Google Gemini:**
- Free tier: 60 requests/minute
- Paid: Very low cost
- **Monthly (20 audits):** Free or <$1

**Worth it?** YES! Prevents costly production bugs.

---

## Security Notes

### **API Keys:**
- ✅ Store in `.env` file (gitignored)
- ❌ Never commit to git
- ❌ Never hardcode in scripts
- ✅ Use environment variables

### **Data Sent to LLM:**
- Test results (pass/fail counts)
- Test names
- Error messages
- **NOT sent:** Database credentials, API keys, user data

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Multiple LLM comparison (GPT-4 vs Gemini vs Claude)
- Historical score tracking
- Auto-generate missing tests
- Integration with CI/CD
- Slack/Email notifications
