# 🔄 Scout94 Retry Logic & Loop Prevention

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### **Maximum Attempts:**
- **Initial run:** 1
- **Max retries:** 3
- **Total attempts:** 4

**Why 3 retries (4 total)?**
- Industry standard (AWS Lambda: 2, Kubernetes: 3, CI/CD: 3)
- Balances giving enough chances vs. not wasting time
- If fundamental issues exist, more retries won't help
- Cost-effective (each retry uses API calls)

---

## 🛡️ **Infinite Loop Prevention**

### **Detection Mechanisms:**

#### **1. Maximum Cap (Hard Limit)**
```
Attempt 1 → Fail (score 3)
Attempt 2 → Fail (score 3) 
Attempt 3 → Fail (score 3)
Attempt 4 → Fail (score 3)
→ STOP! Max 4 attempts reached
→ Deliver failure report
```

#### **2. Stuck Detection (Smart Exit)**
```
Attempt 1 → Score: 3/10
Attempt 2 → Score: 3/10 (same score!)
→ EARLY EXIT! Stuck detected
→ Further retries won't help
→ Deliver failure report
```

**Why this works:**
- If score doesn't improve after retry, system has fundamental issues
- Auditor recommendations aren't being applied or aren't helping
- No point burning API calls and time

#### **3. Score Decline Detection (Warning)**
```
Attempt 1 → Score: 5/10
Attempt 2 → Score: 3/10 (declining!)
→ WARNING! Something got worse
→ Continue but flag the issue
```

## 📊 **Possible Outcomes**

### **Outcome 1: Success ✅**
```
Run 1: Score 3/10 → Retry
Run 2: Score 6/10 → PASS!
→ Generate approved report
→ Deliver results
```

### **Outcome 2: Max Retries ❌**
```
Run 1: Score 3/10 → Retry
Run 2: Score 4/10 → Retry
Run 3: Score 4/10 → Retry
Run 4: Score 5/10 → PASS!
→ Generate approved report
```

### **Outcome 3: Stuck (Early Exit) 🛑**
```
Run 1: Score 2/10 → Retry
Run 2: Score 2/10 (stuck!)
→ EARLY EXIT
→ Generate failure report
→ Deliver anyway
```

### **Outcome 4: Exhausted (Hard Limit) ❌**
```
Run 1: Score 2/10 → Retry
Run 2: Score 3/10 → Retry
Run 3: Score 3/10 → Retry
Run 4: Score 3/10 → STOP!
→ Max attempts reached
→ Generate failure report
→ Deliver anyway
```

## 🚨 **What Gets Delivered**

### **ALL Outcomes Deliver Reports:**

**Success (Score ≥5):**
- ✅ `SCOUT94_AUDITED_REPORT.md`
- Contains: Approved results, score, recommendations

**Failure (Score <5 after retries):**
- ❌ `SCOUT94_AUDIT_FAILED.md`
- Contains: Failure reasons, score history, required fixes
- **You still get a report!** Never left empty-handed.

## 💡 **Why This Design?**

### **Problem Scenarios Prevented:**

#### **Scenario 1: Gemini Misunderstanding Scout94**
```
Scout94 has broken DB connection
→ Tests fail every time
→ Gemini: "Run tests again"
→ Still fails
→ Gemini: "Run tests again"
→ Still fails...

WITHOUT LIMITS: Infinite loop! ♾️

WITH LIMITS: 
→ Detect stuck after 2 same scores
→ Exit early with failure report ✅
```

#### **Scenario 2: Fundamental Project Issues**
```
Project missing critical files
→ Can't be fixed by retry
→ Score stays low

WITHOUT LIMITS: Wastes API calls, time

WITH LIMITS:
→ Max 4 attempts
→ Deliver failure report with issues ✅
```

#### **Scenario 3: Flaky Tests**
```
Run 1: Fail (network issue)
Run 2: Pass (network ok)

WITH RETRIES: Catches temporary issues ✅
```

## 📈 **Score History Tracking**

Every attempt's score is tracked:

```
Attempt 1: 3/10
Attempt 2: 4/10  ← Improving!
Attempt 3: 6/10  ← PASS!

Score History: 3 → 4 → 6
```

**Benefits:**
- See progress over retries
- Detect patterns (stuck, declining, improving)
- Better debugging
- Included in final report

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

Current settings in `run_with_audit.php`:

```php
$maxRetries = 3;  // 3 retries = 4 total attempts
$passingScore = 5; // Minimum score to pass
```

**Can be adjusted based on:**
- Project complexity
- API cost tolerance
- Time constraints
- Testing thoroughness needed

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **For Users:**

1. **Review failure reports** - They contain valuable insights
2. **Fix fundamental issues first** - Don't rely on retries
3. **Monitor score trends** - Improving = good, stuck = problem
4. **Trust the process** - If it exits early, there's a reason

### **For the System:**

1. ✅ Always deliver a report (success or failure)
2. ✅ Detect and exit stuck states early
3. ✅ Track score history for debugging
4. ✅ Provide clear exit reasons
5. ✅ Balance retries vs. efficiency

## 📊 **Mathematical Justification**

### **Why Not More Retries?**

**Probability Analysis:**
- If each retry has 50% chance of improvement
- 4 attempts = 93.75% chance of at least one success
- 5 attempts = 96.875% chance
- **Diminishing returns:** +3.125% for +25% more attempts

**Cost Analysis:**
- Each attempt: ~1 minute + API cost
- 4 attempts = 4 minutes, reasonable
- 10 attempts = 10 minutes, too long

**Law of Diminishing Returns:**
```
Attempts | Success Probability | Time | Cost
---------|-------------------|------|------
1        | 50%               | 1min | $0.10
2        | 75%               | 2min | $0.20
3        | 87.5%             | 3min | $0.30
4        | 93.75%            | 4min | $0.40 ← Optimal
5        | 96.875%           | 5min | $0.50
10       | 99.9%             | 10min| $1.00 ← Not worth it
```

**Conclusion:** 3-4 attempts is the sweet spot.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Tests keep failing with same score"**
→ Stuck detection will exit early  
→ Review failure report for root causes

### **"Auditor seems harsh"**
→ Good! It's finding real issues  
→ Address the recommendations

### **"Want more/fewer retries"**
→ Edit `$maxRetries` in `run_with_audit.php`  
→ Range: 1-5 recommended

### **"Score declining on retries"**
→ Something in retry process is breaking things  
→ Check what changed between attempts
